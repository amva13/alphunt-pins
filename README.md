#### Description:
NFT Masonry and Search Engine

This project includes a Python webscraper and React app providing a masonry and search engine for NFTs from nftscan.com

I wanted to build a layout better showcasing the digital artwork of NFTs. I've found marketplaces tend to highlight the trading statistics more than the artwork itself.
